Complex solution to optimize a client's 14-page sign-up process. The objective was to enhance user
interaction by strategically reordering the flow, enabling jumps between pages (e.g., page 10 to page 3 and
vice-versa) to present more pertinent questions earlier. Faced with a system lacking API support for flow
management, I developed a custom overlay that dynamically controlled the user's journey while maintaining
consistent URL targets with the original system. This advanced Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) test
significantly improved the sign-up experience.
